## TODO

- Add security rules (maybe ratelimits?) to images route to prevent abuse

  - What is the best way to do this?
  - Maybe look into arcjet again?

- Ask in svelte Discord, how to manage state with "before now data" and "after now data"

  - Two pages, one with the current data and one with the past data
  - Since current data is more important, should past data be in its own store on the page?

- Find out why bulk deletion of images doesn't work
